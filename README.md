# Prework Study Guid Webpage

## Description


I wanted to develop interactable webpages and/or apps that can interact with my PLC code and tags. I built this project to give me a good starting position on how coding works in a scripted language. So far, learning how to format HTML and applying styles has been very pratical in making a webpage accessable and intuitive.
